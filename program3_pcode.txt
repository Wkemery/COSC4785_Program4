gonna use inheritance

have a tree of Nodes

each of the types of grammar will inherit from Node
big list

program
classdec
classbody
vardec, etc...

id

i think i will have a vector of subnodes in the top level Node class which will be inherited by all other nodes. It makes more sense to me to reference by 0 1 2 than resultype id paramlist block. should also help, because i don't need to know exactly what I'm referencing, just that it is there.
